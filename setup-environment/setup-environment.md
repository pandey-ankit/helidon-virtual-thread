# Setup the Environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to setup the required environment for the Workshop.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Code Editor

The Code Editor enables you to edit and deploy code for various OCI services directly from the OCI Console. You can now update service workflows and scripts without having to switch between the Console and your local development environments. This makes it easy to rapidly prototype cloud solutions, explore new services, and accomplish quick coding tasks.

Code Editor's direct integration with Cloud Shell allows you access to the GraalVM Enterprise Native Image and JDK 17 (Java Development Kit) pre-installed in Cloud Shell.
